              A kindrednote is just what it sounds like, a kind note. It could
              be a simple note to say something kind or a quote that‚Äôs had a
              positive impact. It could be a story, an experience or a thought.
              Our intention is to spread kindness and increase empathy by
              demonstrating that despite our many differences in perspectives,
              beliefs and values, that at the core, we are all the same.

              ‚Äúkindred‚Äù spirits that remind us that despite our many differences

                <p className="paragraph">
                  Studies have shown that kind acts can lower blood pressure,
                  pain, stress and depression while increasing self-esteem and

                <p className="paragraph">
                  Kindness not only benefits the recipient of the kindness but
                  also the person doing the kind act and the people observing
                  the kindness. Studies have shown that the person giving the
                  kindness sometimes benefit as much as the recipient of the
                  good deed. Kindness is teachable and compassion can be
                  cultivated when people observe acts of kindness.

                  Kindness can set off a chain reaction in a ‚Äúpay it forward‚Äù
